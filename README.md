# savop
SAVOP Launch Project,  use with sav-reference-router and sav-agent project.
savop aims at building all the startup scripts and configuration files for the SAVOP project.
We implemented a Master-Host-Container architecture, where the Master generates all the configurations for SAV-agent and deploy them to the Hosts.
The Host will manage its container and submit the status to the Master(Planned but not done yet).
